# NeuroLumen

## Overview
This project is about creating an AI system that simulates a DMX stream for dance music live shows in the style of an operator whose data it's been trained on. By integrating audio signal processing and machine learning techniques, the AI will be trained to generate DMX signals in response to musical inputs, emulating the human lighting operator’s style and decisions.

## Project Objectives
1. **Operating with DMX & Artnet Protocols**
2. **Data Collection**
3. **Exploring Audio DSP and MFCC**: Investigating Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for music genre recognition to enhance the AI model’s responsiveness to audio inputs.
4. **Iterative AI Development**

## Data Requirements
For each show, the following data will be collected:
- **Personality List**: Information about the types and parameters of lighting fixtures used.
- **Lighting Patch**: Details on which parameters are patched to specific DMX addresses.
- **Positions**: Layout details of the lighting rig.
- **Time-Stamped Audio Recording**: The audio recording of the show.
- **Time-Stamped DMX Stream**: The recorded DMX output from the lighting desk.

## Join the Project
If you are passionate about combining technology with creative arts, particularly in the realm of live performance lighting, we encourage you to contribute to this project. 

*Note: This project is currently in the conceptual stage.*
